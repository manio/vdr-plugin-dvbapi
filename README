DVBAPI plugin for VDR

  The plugin is simplified version of VDR-SC plugin, with modifications from dvbapi-patch.tar.gz.
  
Refer to INSTALL/README for installation and usage procedure

Can be freely distributed and modified under GPL lincense.

NOTE TO NEW LINUX USERS: All lines that are prefixed with the '$'
character are commands that need to be typed into a terminal window /
console (similar to the command prompt for Windows). Note that the '$'
character itself should NOT be typed as part of the command.

2. Getting the source code
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will have to grab the source code of course. First install the git
package provided by your distribution. Then from a terminal, type:

   $ cd /usr/local/src/vdr/PLUGINS/srv
   $ git clone .

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Basic Installation 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
configure, build, and install this package. 

 Run`configure --help' for more details.

Using:
 1) Start the softcam with LD_PRELOAD:
 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/dvbapi_ca.so /usr/local/bin/oscam -b
 
 2) Start the VDR with dvbpi plugin
 /usr/local/bin/vdr -c /etc/vdr -E /var/vdr -L /usr/local/lib/vdr -P dvbapi 

 3) In the oscam.conf file add following options
	[dvbapi]
	enabled = 1
	au = 1
	boxtype = pc    
	user = vdr
	pmt_mode = 1
	request_mode = 1

   boxtype to "pc" will allow oscam to take adapter/demux information from CAPMT frame.
   pmt_mode to "1" will allow oscam to use camd.socket in /tmp/ dir
